#  Meditor


Meditor is a markdown editor built by me (Zed)

The goal for this editor is to build something lightweight and easily customizable
while keeping the feature set minimal and bloat free
at the moment the editor has the following features

- markdown is displayed with appropriate theme colours
- headers text size is smaller/larger depending on the level it is (eg. ## is smaller then #)
- export to pdf (NOTE: pdf will not look the same as the rendered markdown)
- view markdown rendered, with a variety of themes to choose from [here](https://github.com/jasonm23/markdown-css-themes)
- pretty alerts when you export/change theme and more 

**Future features** 
- build custom themes in app
-
